# Innovation Brief — Predictive Delivery Optimizer

**Company:** NexGen Logistics Pvt. Ltd.  
**Problem:** Late deliveries impact customer satisfaction, increase redeliveries/credits, and raise costs.  
**Goal:** Predict late deliveries early and recommend quick, practical actions.

## Why this matters
- Customers switch providers after repeated SLA misses.
- Even a small reduction in late orders improves NPS and reduces penalty credits.
- A simple, reliable predictor can steer proactive ops decisions.

## Approach
- Merge order, delivery, route, and cost data by `order_id`.
- Create derived label `is_late` from `actual_delivery_hours > promised_delivery_hours` (with 0.5h buffer).
- Train a **Random Forest** using priority, distance, traffic/weather flags, costs, and lane attributes.
- Score current/in-transit orders to raise alerts, not just explain the past.

## What the prototype shows
- **EDA** to understand lanes, priorities, and lateness distribution.
- **Model tab** to train/tune and view AUC, confusion matrix, and top features.
- **At-Risk Orders** list with probabilities, thresholding, and estimated savings from proactive interventions.

## Expected Business Impact (illustrative)
Let:
- Predicted-late alerts per week: `N`
- Avoidance rate through interventions: `α` (e.g., 30%)
- Average penalty/credit per late order: `₹P`

**Estimated savings:** `N × α × ₹P` per week.  
The app calculates this dynamically.

## Quick Wins (no heavy IT changes)
- Upgrade priority or switch carrier on high-risk lanes
- Avoid peak traffic windows
- Assign newer / more efficient vehicles to long lanes
- Transparent ops dashboard for daily stand-ups

## Next Steps
- Add service calendar, live traffic, and micro-weather feeds
- Lane-specific models for more accuracy
- Feedback loop: label predicted orders with outcomes to keep learning
